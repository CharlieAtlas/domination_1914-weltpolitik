Intro_Germany=<body>The German Empire marches to war in support of its ally Austria-Hungary.  After<br>Russia meddled in an affair touching national honor, and refused to de-mobilize<br>its forces, German High Command was forced to activate the Schlieffen Plan, to<br>knock out France in the West while delaying Russia in the East.  For decades,<br>revanchist France has sought to encircle Germany militarily, and isolate<br>Germany diplomatically.  It was a disappointment, then, when Belgium not only<br>refused Germany's reasonable request to transit its territory, but actively<br>took up arms against German forces.  Even though Germany fully intended to<br>relinquish control of any Belgian territory after the conclusion of<br>hostilities, the British saw an opportunity to cripple the ascendant German<br>Empire, and declared war.<br><br>Kaiser Wilhelm II Hohenzollern has presided over a vast expansion of the German<br>Empire.  Germany now has colonies in Togoland, Kamerun, German Southwest<br>Africa, German East Africa, Tsingtao in China, and German New Guinea.<br>Unfortunately, these colonies will likely have to fend for themselves.<br><br>The High Seas Fleet of the Kaiserliche Marine faces the Russian Baltic Fleet<br>and the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet.  There are also squadrons in the Caribbean,<br>off the coast of South America, and in the Far East.  Unfortunately, there are<br>also lone cruisers caught between stations, such as the SMS Konigsberg off<br>German East Africa, the SMS Goeben in the Eastern Mediterranean, and the SMS<br>Geier at Singapore.  Fortunately for the Goeben, Germany has just concluded a<br>secret treaty with the Ottoman Empire, allowing passage of German ships and<br>forces across Ottoman territory.  Regardless, likely the most impactful arm of<br>the German Navy is the submarine U-boat fleet.<br><br>Diplomatically, Germany must continue to seek allies.  Italy and Romania, while<br>members of the Triple Alliance, have opted to remain neutral for now.  Germany<br>should seek their entry on favorable terms.  As well, Bulgaria may be willing<br>to enter the conflict against Serbia.  Germany may also encounter opportunities<br>to support local independence movements in Entente territory, which may drain<br>Entente attention and resources.  As well, Germany already has tentative<br>relationships with the Constitutionalist government of Venustiano Carranza in<br>Mexico.  Aiding the Carranza faction in the Mexican Revolution may pay<br>dividends in the future.</body>
Intro_France=<body>Warmongering Germany has declared war on France and its ally Russia.  The time<br>has finally come for France to avenge its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and<br>liberate the Alsace-Lorraine from its German occupiers.<br><br>Raymond Poincare, President of the Third Republic, has entrusted the defense of<br>France to Marshal Joseph Joffre.  France has the advantage of fighting on its<br>own turf, its strong defensive line anchored at both ends, on the left by the<br>British, Belgians, and the Channel, and on the right by Switzerland.<br><br>Elsewhere, France must protect its colonies in West Africa, Madagascar, and<br>Indochina.  There is a sizeable force in Morocco, dealing with the insurgency<br>of the Zaian Federation, who refuse to submit themselvs to French authority.<br>It may prove necessary to evacuate some of these forces back to Europe using<br>the Mediterranean Fleet.<br><br>Regardless, France should seek out new allies and flanks elsewhere.  Italy,<br>Romania, and Greece all have factions that are sympathetic to France.  Such<br>should be encouraged.</body>
Intro_Austria=<body>Cowardly Serbian terrorists, armed and trained by the Serbian government, have<br>assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, nephew and heir to the good Emperor<br>Franz Joseph.  Germany has assured Austria-Hungary of its support, and the<br>Empire's ambassadors have presented an ultimatum to Serbia to:<br>1. Suppress anti-Hapsburg publications and agitations for Bosian independence<br>2. Dissolve the Narodna Odbrana, a nationalist paramilitary organization<br>3. Eliminate from public education all propaganda against Austria-Hungary<br>4. Remove from office civil and military personnel to be named by the Empire<br>5. Accept representatives from Austria-Hungary to suppress Serbian subversives<br>6. Agree to a joint investigation of the assassination<br>7. Arrest two known conspirators in the plot<br>8. Halt arms traffic across the border and censure derelict border officials<br>9. Explain anti-Imperial utterances by Serbian government officials<br>10. Notify the Imperial government without delay of acceptance of the above<br><br>Serbia has refused, and now Austria-Hungary must wage a war for national pride.<br>As a dual monarchy, Austria and Hungary have two separate economies with a<br>unified foreign policy.  As of now, the Empire faces war on two fronts: Serbia<br>and Russia.  The Imperial navy in the Adriatic may not be of immediate use.<br>A lone cruiser, the Kaiserin Elisabeth, is on station in faraway Tsingtao, and<br>it is anticipated that Japan will enter the war on the side of the Entente.<br><br>During the years of peace, Imperial military spending has not matched that of<br>the other Great Powers.  Despite this, so long as the other members of the<br>Triple Alliance can be swayed to join Austria-Hungary's side, or at the very<br>least, remain neutral, the Empire's position is defensible.</body>
Intro_Japan=<body>The Great Powers of Europe are at each others' throats.  The Empire of Japan<br>has an alliance with another great island power, the British Empire.  The<br>Empire is relatively new to its Great Power status, but in the past twenty<br>years Japan has added Taiwan and Korea to its colonial holdings.<br><br>Emperor Taisho has only recently succeeded to the throne, but Prime Minister<br>Okuma Shigenobu is keen to honor the spirit of its treaty with the British.<br>While technically Japan is under no obligation to come to the aid of Britain,<br>Britain having declared war on Germany first, war might offer opportunities to<br>seize German Territory in the Pacific and expend Japanese influence further<br>into China, thus gaining an advantage over Japan's regional rival, the United<br>States.</body>
Intro_Italy=<body>Germany and Austria-Hungary have gone to war.  As a member of the Triple<br>Alliance, Italy is obliged to come to their defense, but Austria-Hungary<br>declared war first, voiding Italy's treaty obligations.  Thus, Italy remains<br>neutral for the time being.<br><br>King Victor Emmanuel III of the House of Savoy, advised by Prime Minister<br>Antonio Salandra, reigns over a much expanded Kingdom of Italy.  During the<br>Scramble for Africa, Italy gained Eritrea and Somaliland, though the attempt to<br>conquer Abyssinia was catastrophically unsuccessful.  More recently, the<br>Kingdom was victorious over the Ottoman Empire, seizing Libya and the<br>Dodecanese, though Senussi partisans in Libya have not yet been fully pacified.<br><br>While Prime Minister Salandra believes making arrangements with the Entente<br>Powers would ultimately prove more beneficial for the Kingdom, perhaps securing<br>territorial concessions in Trieste and Tyrol, lands currently held by Italy's<br>nominal ally Austria-Hungary, there is significant anti-war sentiment in the<br>legislature.  The Prime Minister is adamant, however, that Italy must enter the<br>war before it ends, and it must enter at the crucial point, to maximize its<br>contribution, and thus reap the greatest rewards in the peace treaties to<br>follow.</body>
Intro_USA=<body>The United States has adopted a policy of neutrality in the European war.<br>Though public opinion is split, there is a slight tilt towards the Entente.<br>Trade continues, but due to the British blockade, very few American goods can<br>reach Germany and Austria-Hungary.<br><br>The United States, currently led by Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, has<br>territories and obligations around the globe.  Current territories include<br>Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  U.S. forces just<br>recently put down an independence movement in the Philippines, and tensions in<br>the area are still high.  The nations of Cuba and Panama are also United States<br>protectorates; their foreign policy is conducted by the U.S. in exchange for<br>military protection from imperialist European powers.  Nicaragua is officially<br>under occupation by the U.S. at the request of the Conservative government<br>there.<br><br>But the largest commitment of U.S. forces is currently in Veracruz, which was<br>occupied as a result of the Tampico Affair.  Though Huerta is now out of power,<br>the leader of the so-called Constitutionalists, Venustiano Carranza, has proven<br>himself to be virulently anti-American.  Various American interests have<br>flirted with support of Francisco Villa.<br><br>Above all, the United States must uphold the Monroe Doctrine, and especially<br>ensure that no malign German influence creeps into the region.  The United<br>States must also check the expansion of its Pacific rival, the Empire of Japan.</body>
Intro_Ottoman=<body>Christian Europe is aflame with war.  The arrogant Winston Churchill of Britain<br>has seized the Sultan Osman I and Resadiye, battleships which the Empire bought<br>and paid for.  To add further insult, the British refused to refund the<br>treasure which the Empire had already poured out to pay for their construction.<br><br>Mehmed V, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Caliph of Islam, must retaliate against<br>such duplicity.  The sultan is advised by members of the Committee of Union and<br>Progress:  Minister of War Ismail Enver Pasha, Grand Vizier Mehmed Talaat<br>Pasha, and Minister of the Navy Djemal Pasha.  The Committee has concluded a<br>secret treaty with Germany whereby Germany undertakes to defend the Empire, and<br>the Empire undertakes to defend Germany, but only if Bulgaria also fights.  To<br>that end, the Empire has also concluded another secret alliance with Bulgaria.<br><br>The Sublime Porte has decreed passage through the Dardanelles and the Bosporus<br>closed to all shipping except for the Central Powers.  The Entente might<br>foolishly declare war, but the Empire stands ready.  After the recent losses<br>of Libya and the Balkans, the Committee of Union and Progress has already<br>undertaken a modernization program, and the Empire may be able to regain what<br>was lost.  As the Empire's ancient enemy Persia is under the influence of<br>Russia and Britain, that old score can be settled as well.<br><br>The dangers of such a path are overland invasion from the Caucasus and the<br>Sinai, and an amphibious assault from India.  The Russian Black Sea Fleet is<br>also a danger on the Northern frontiers.<br><br>The Arabs to the South are split between warring factions.  The Hejaz and Asir<br>are Ottoman subjects, and the Emirate of Jabal Shammar is friendly, leaving<br>only the Emirate of Nejd and Hasa.<br><br>One final option is for the Caliph to proclaim a jihad.  No doubt the entire<br>Islamic world will rise up in support of the Caliph!</body>
Intro_UK=<body>The British Empire must march to war to honor its alliances with France and<br>Russia, and to uphold international treaties ensuring the neutrality of<br>Belgium.<br><br>His Majesty King George V's government, led by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, of<br>the Liberal Party is fully prepared for the challenges presented by waging a<br>global war.  The Empire can call upon the might of its far-flung semi-<br>autonomous Dominions: Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and<br>Newfoundland.  Finally, the government can call upon the Provinces of India,<br>Crown Jewel of the Empire.<br><br>German Africa will no doubt prove to be valuable additions to the Empire,<br>especially German East Africa, which should fulfill the dream of a railway from<br>Cape Town to Cairo.  South Africa has also expressed interest in incorporating<br>German Southwest Africa.<br><br>Australia and New Zealand, who have combined their militaries into ANZAC, can<br>quickly seize the German Pacific territories, freeing their troops for<br>disposition elsewhere.<br><br>First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill is more than qualified to command<br>His Majesty's Navy.  From its blocking positions in the North Sea and the<br>Channel, the German High Seas Fleet is trapped by the Grand Fleet.  However,<br>there are smaller flotillas and squadrons scattered around the globe:  the<br>Mediterranean, the Falklands, South Africa, and the Gulf of Guinea.  In<br>addition, the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Indian Marine, and the Royal<br>Australian Navy have put themselves at the disposal of central command.  The<br>biggest threat may come from the U-boats beneath the waves...<br><br>There are rumblings that the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria may be tempted to<br>throw their lot in with Germany.  In fact, the Ottomans have already closed off<br>passage to the Black Sea, cutting off reinforcement to the Russians via the<br>Black Sea.  India is eager to respond forcefully to this provocation, as the<br>Provinces have expansionist designs on Mesopotamia.  The defeat of the Turks<br>would ensure continued British influence in neighboring Persia, and remove the<br>threat of support for the "Mad Mullah" Mohammad Abdullah Hassan in the Horn of<br>Africa.<br><br>The Empire of Japan has assured the government that they will stand in<br>solidarity against the German threat.  But the Empire's diplomats should seek<br>more allies, such as Italy and the United States.</body>
Intro_Bolshevik=<body>This war between capitalists must be resisted at all costs.  The proletariat<br>will be used up as cannon fodder by aristocrats and the bourgeois governments.<br>The Bolsheviks remain true to the principles of Revolution, unlike the other<br>members of the Communist International, who have betrayed socialism by<br>supporting the war along nationalist lines.<br><br>The leader of the Party, Vladimir Lenin, was unfortunately in Galicia at the<br>outbreak of hostilities, and was arrested by Austrian authorities.  For now,<br>the Party must wait until the time is right to overthrow the capitalist<br>hierarchy and secure the future for the workers of the world!</body>
Intro_Russia=<body>Not satisfied with its annexation of Bosnia, the decadent Hapsburg Empire is<br>trying to conquer yet another Slavic nation, and must be stopped!  Ignoring<br>calls for international mediation, or even a joint investigation into the<br>alleged assassination in Sarajevo, Austria-Hungary has made plain its so-called<br>grievances are simply flimsy pretexts for further territorial expansion.  As<br>defender of the Slavic world, the Russian Empire must stand against this unjust<br>aggression.<br><br>Tsar Nicholas II Romanov, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias, has<br>appointed his cousin, the Grand Duke Nicholas, as supreme commander of the<br>Imperial Russian Armies.<br><br>The Empire faces warmongering Germany and its cat's paw Austria-Hungary<br>isolated from its allies in the Entente, France and the British Empire.  The<br>Polish salient is extremely exposed to attack, and the Pripet Marshes are an<br>obstacle to mutual reinforcement of Northern and Southern defensive axes.  The<br>vast size of the Empire can provide defensive advantages, but improvements to<br>the logistics network are crucial.<br><br>The Imperial Russian Navy is divided into three fleets.   The Baltic fleet<br>faces nearly the entirety of the German Kaiserliche Marine.  The Black Sea<br>fleet is restricted by the Ottoman closure of the Hellespont.  And the Far East<br>fleet must contend with German commerce raiders.  The Arctic flotilla is the<br>only squadron which can coordinate with Russia's allies.<br><br>The ancient Ottoman Empire may foolishly throw its lot in with Germany.  The<br>Turks could threaten the Caucasus region as well as Russian influence in Persia<br>in the short term.  However, Russia's inevitable victory will finally liberate<br>the Sublime Porte on behalf of Christendom!</body>

Intro_Bulgaria=<body>The Balkans are aflame with war again.  Austria-Hungary has declared war on<br>Serbia, and Russia has declared war on Austria-Hungary.  This may be Bulgaria's<br>opportunity to seek revenge on Serbia for its betrayal during the Second Balkan<br>War.<br><br>Tsar Ferdinand I and his Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov have negotiated a<br>secret treaty with the Ottoman Empire, despite historical animosities.<br>However, Entente intelligence services are likely aware of Bulgaria's tilt<br>against Serbia.  In fact, in matters of diplomacy, the Entente has no carrots,<br>only sticks.  And there are suspicious troop movements to the South, on the<br>frontier with Greece.</body>
Intro_Greece=<body>The Balkans have erupted in war yet again.  Though the Kingdom of Greece has a<br>defensive alliance with Serbia, it is only in case of attack by Bulgaria.<br>Greece is not obligated, nor equipped, to come to Serbia's aid against the<br>Great Powers.<br><br>King Constantine I is brother-in-law to Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, and cousin<br>to Tsar Nicholas of Russia.  The  king himself personally leans toward his<br>brother-in-law Kaiser Wilhelm, but has adopted an official position of<br>neutrality.  Prime Minister Venizelos is pro-Entente, and is maneuvering for a<br>Greek entry into the war on the side of the Entente.  So long as Tsar Nicholas<br>also shields the king from the full force of Entente diplomatic pressure,<br>Greece is likely to remain neutral.<br><br>However, the chaos may allow opportunities for Greek expansion into neutral<br>Albania, while the Powers are otherwise occupied.</body>
Intro_Romania=<body>Germany and Austria-Hungary have gone to war.  The Kingdom of Romania is<br>secretly a member of the Triple Alliance, but it is a defensive alliance, and<br>Austria-Hungary declared war first.  Italy has decided to use this loophole and<br>remain neutral.<br><br>King Carol I Hohenzollern, distant cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, would<br>fight for honor's sake on the side of Germany, but among his ministers there is<br>a significant Francophile faction.  They argue that entering the war on the<br>side of the Entente would yield greater rewards, such as Transylvania in<br>Hungary, which has a significant Romanian population.<br><br>For now, Romania remains neutral.  If Romania joins the war, it should do so on<br>the winning side.  No doubt Italy will do the same...</body>
Intro_Serbia=<body>The Hapsburgs of Austria-Hungary have unjustly accused Serbia of sponsoring<br>terrorism in Sarajevo, presenting a list of draconian demands in flagrant<br>violation of both Serbia's sovereignty and international norms.  When the<br>Kingdom of Serbia justifiably rejected such outrageous demands, the decaying<br>Hapsburg Empire declared war.  However, though circumstances are dire, this war<br>also presents an opportunity to revive the greatness of the Serbian Empire of<br>old!<br><br>In light of his advanced age, King Petar I Karadordevic has wisely appointed<br>Crown Prince Aleksandar as regent for the duration of hostilities.  With the<br>steady leadership of Prime Minister Nikola Pasic, Serbia's ultimate victory is<br>assured.<br><br>The immediate military situation appears dire.  Though the Hapsburg Empire is<br>in decline, it is still one of the Great Powers, with a much larger military.<br>And Serbia's capital is vulnerable, just a short march from the border.  To the<br>East, no doubt jealous Bulgaria and the decrepit Ottoman Empire would relish<br>taking this opportunity to steal territory from Serbia.<br><br>However, Serbia is supported by its allies in the Entente, Great Powers Russia,<br>France, and the British Empire.  To the West, King Nikola of Montenegro,<br>despite attempted Hapsburg bribes, stands in solidarity with their fellow<br>Slavs, and has agreed to joint military command under the command of Serbian<br>general Bozidar Jankovic.  To the Southwest, Albania is roiled by chaos, though<br>perhaps this presents tactical opportunities.  And to the South, while Serbia<br>has a defensive alliance with Greece, it is only in case of attack by Bulgaria;<br>therefore, Greece is remaining neutral for the time being, though Serbian<br>forces may still transit Greek territory.</body>

Intro_Belgium=<body>When the Great Powers of Europe went to war with each other, this was none of<br>Belgium's concern.  However, when the German Empire requested transit through<br>Belgian territory in violation of the Kingdom's neutrality, guaranteed by<br>international treaty, Belgium refused.  Thwarted, the voracious German Army<br>decided to invade and occupy the Kingdom of Belgium, and began the Rape of<br>Belgium.<br><br>Retaining only a fraction of the country, King Albert I has fled and<br>established a government in exile in Le Havre, France.  From here, Belgium can<br>raise troops to man the extreme left flank of the Western Front, and coordinate<br>with its allies.  The government can also continue to administer the Belgian<br>Congo and the Chinese concession in Tientsin.</body>
Intro_Portugal=<body>The Great Powers of Europe have finally gone to war with one another.  Already,<br>Germany has requested transit rights through Portugese East Africa and Angola.<br>Not only is this a violation of Portugese neutrality, but it is suspected that<br>this is simply a ploy to annex Portugese Africa.  The German Empire refused to<br>honor the right of the Republic of Portugal to violate its neutrality, and now<br>a de facto state of war exists.  Germany clearly hungers for Portugal's<br>colonies:  Guinea, Angola, Portugese East Africa, Goa, Macao, and Timor.<br><br>While the Republic of Portugal is young, only having thrown off the yoke of the<br>monarchy in 1910, President Manuel de Arriaga is trusted to lead the nation<br>through this crisis.  The Republic faces threats from within by counter-<br>revolutionary monarchists, and from without by Germany, Spain, and the British<br>Empire.  An official declaration of war when the time is right will ally<br>Portugal with the British Empire, and protect Portugal from Spain.  Victory in<br>war will protect Portugal from Germany.</body>
Intro_Arabia=<body>Tidings have come of faraway wars, but these are of little concern to Arabia.<br>Abdulaziz Al Saud, Emir of Nejd and Hasa, is focused on unifying the disparate<br>Arab peoples.  Already, he is recruiting the recently converted Bedouin tribes<br>into the Ikhwan.<br><br>The Englishman William Shakespear is a personal friend of Abdulaziz, and if<br>ever war was to break out between Shakespear's people and the decaying Ottoman<br>Empire, naturally the Emir would honor his friendships... and also seize the<br>opportunity to settle ancient feuds.  Abdulaziz's rival Hussein bin Ali, Sharif<br>of Mecca, is a craven subject of the Turks, while Sa'd bin Abdulaziz, Emir of<br>Jabal Shammar, is a mere puppet of the Ottoman Empire.  Meanwhile, to the<br>Southwest, Sayyid Muhammad ibn Ali seeks to free Asir of the Ottomans and crush<br>his rival, the Imam of Yemen.</body>
Intro_Brazil=<body>Brazil has adopted a policy of neutrality towards the European war.  There is a<br>slight tilt torwards the Entente in public opinion, but attention is focused on<br>more local matters.  There is a deadnought arms race with Brazil's regional rivals<br>Argentina and Chile, which Brazil is winning.  And Brazil is involved in the<br>Mexican Revolution, trying to broker a peace between the warring factions.<br>Brazil, along with Argentina and Chile, attended the Niagara Falls Conference<br>in Canada to prevent full-blown war between the United States and Mexico over<br>the illegal occupation of Veracruz by the Americans.<br><br>President Hermes de Fonseca technically remains in power, but Vice President<br>Venceslau Bras won the election and will take office in November.  In addition<br>to foreign diplomatic issues, there is also the continuing Contestado War in<br>the South, against the religious fanatics there.</body>

Intro_Conventionist=<body>Victoriano Huerta has been overthrown by the forces of the Revolution.  Led by<br>General Francisco "Pancho" Villa of the Division del Norte and General Emiliano<br>Zapata of the Liberation Army of the South, the successive corrupt central<br>governments have been put to flight.<br><br>Pursuant to the Treaty of Torreon between the Revolutionary forces, a "Great<br>Convention of Commanding Military Chiefs and State Governors" should meet to<br>determine the fate of the country.  No doubt the Convention would ratify the<br>policy of land reform and redistribute resources properly to the peasants.<br><br>However, the supporters of Venustiano Carranza have denied entry to Mexico<br>City to all other groups, raising fears that they may betray the principles of<br>the Revolution and seize power for themselves.  And in the far South, rebel<br>Maya have refused recognition of central authority.  But the majority of the<br>country has pledged to submit to the results of the Convention.  Business<br>interests in the United States also continue to support the Revolution with<br>money and guns.</body>
Intro_Constitutionalist=<body>Victoriano Huerta and his vile federale government seized power and executed<br>the democratically elected President Francisco Madero.  Huerta compounded his <br>illainy with incompetence, provoking a confrontation with the United States, <br>esulting in the illegal occupation of Veracruz by United States marines.<br><br>Fortunately, First Chief Venustiano Carranza, successor to President Madero,<br>and the Commander-in-Chief of the Constitutional Army, General Alvaro Obregon,<br>have just retaken Mexico City, forcing Huerta to flee the country.<br><br>However, the Revolution is not yet done.  The rebel Zapata still has sizeable<br>forces in the field, and far to the South, rebel Maya in the Yucatan do not<br>acknowledge the authority of the central government.  The biggest threat is<br>the insubordinate bandit, "General" Francisco Villa, who publicly supported the<br>occupation of Veracruz and is funded by the occupiers.<br><br>The Constitutionalists control all of the major industrial centers, and the<br>German Kaiser has cautiously extended an offer of support.</body>

Intro_KMT=<body>The Kuomintang is a nationalist party devoted to democracy in China.  It was<br>founded by Song Jiaoren, though it is currently led by Sun Yat-sen, who is in<br>exile.  During the Xinhai Revolution to overthrow the Qing Emperor,<br>Revolutionary forces had to make a bargain with the Beiyang Armies, promising<br>the provisional presidency to Yuan Shikai if he could force Emperor Puyi's<br>abdication.  However, after the KMT won parliamentary elections, Song Jiaoren<br>was assassinated by Yuan Shikai.  Seven provinces rebelled against the Beiyang,<br>but were ultimately defeated, and Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan.  For now, an<br>uneasy peace reigns, but conflict could reignite at any moment.<br><br>Japan has been attempting to buy influence with all factions, but more so the<br>Beiyang in the North.  If Japan enters the war against Germany, it may be<br>possible for the South to secure funding from Germany.</body>
Intro_Beiyang=<body>The European war is of no concern to the Republic of China.  Interim President<br>Yuan Shikai, formerly of the Beiyang Army, currently leads the country in<br>recognition of his contributions to the overthrow of the Qing Emperor during<br>the Xinhai Revolution.  As one of the few modern armies, using Western weapons<br>and tactics, the Beiyang Army, which Yuan Shikai was instrumental in building,<br>provided aid at the crucial moment during the Revolution.  For now, President<br>Shikai and the loyal generals of the Beiyang Armies rule with a steady hand,<br>quashing internal dissent for the maintenance of order and stability.</body>
